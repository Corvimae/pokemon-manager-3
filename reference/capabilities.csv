While Kangaskhan has the Baby Template, it cannot be Commanded to fight or take any action. Mother Kangaskhan with a Baby in their pouch are exceptional at protecting their babies; attacks cannot target Kangaskhan inside their mother’s pouch while she is conscious. Trainers raising a Kangaskhan may choose to have their Mother Kangaskhan gain 20% less experience from any sources and give that Experience to the baby instead.

48,Mountable X,0,"This Pokémon may serve as a mount for X average Trainers regardless of Power Capability and ignoring penalties for weight carried.

Wild Pokémon that are of this Pokémon’s unevolved form or at least 10 levels lower than the user will instantly obey the user’s commands; showing a Pokémon with Pack Mon to a group of Wilds will put them at a Fearful disposition. However, two Pack Mons of the same species and within 10 Levels of each other will fight for dominance of the group. If a Wild Pack Leader is ten levels higher than your Pokémon, it will expect your Pokémon to obey it, and may attack if it does not.",3/9/2021 15:52:53,3/9/2021 15:52:53

55,Premonition,0,"Pokémon with this Capability have a supernatural sense for natural disasters such as earthquakes, floods, and volcanic eruptions. The magnitude of the impending disaster and its proximity to the Pokémon both affect how often they get this sense before a disaster and how long in advance the warning is. Closer and bigger disasters tend to have a greater effect and may alert the Pokémon to the specific area where a disaster will occur days in advance, while lesser disasters may simply give the Pokémon an odd sense of unease several hours before they hit.",3/9/2021 15:52:53,3/9/2021 15:52:53
56,Reach,0,"A Pokémon with Reach has the Range of their Melee attacks increased based on their size category; Small and Medium Pokémon may make Melee attacks from up to 2 meters away, and Large and bigger Pokémon may make Melee attacks from up to 3 meters away.

When using this Capability, the user cannot increase or decrease its total mass by more than 50%, and they cannot replicate complex machines such as computers or phones. They may take on the appearance of these devices, but they will appear simplified in comparison. They can, however, transform into other moving forms such as acting as someone’s prosthetic limb, a living lever or pulley system, or a Pokémon comparable in size. Note in this last case that the Shapeshifter doesn’t gain any qualities of that Pokémon without actually using the Move Transform!

When lifting Staggering Weights with Telekinesis, they roll Focus instead of Athletics, and the DC is 10 instead of 4. They can target objects up to 8 meters away. Count the combined weight of all objects when determining whether they can lift all of them. Using this Capability to lift the user’s Drag Weight or greater leaves discoverable psychic residue. Additionally, the user may use Struggle Attacks at a range of X, where X is the user’s Focus Rank. These Struggle Attacks deal Normal-Type Damage as usual, but the user may add their Special Attack instead of their Attack and have the attack deal Special Damage, if they wish. The user may perform the Disarm, Trip, and Push Maneuvers at the range of your Telekinetic Capability and using the Focus Skill for all opposed rolls.
